# TransportTracker

This is a web page that I have written to help out my local univeristy skydiving society.
This project adds an extra webpage to a prexisting website. For this reason, I have kept the file called "header.php", which copies the website builder generated themes and header from the other site pages, to keep a smooth and cohesive site, as well as allowing other members not familar with coding websites to still edit the main site with a website builder. By keeping this in a separate file, it allows the header to be changed if need be. 

The rest of the files are all my own code.

The project breaks down into two php files, "forms.php" and "submitTrip.php", which are used to diplay and upload journeys from the local area. "style.css" is my separate stylesheet. 

This project is still in progress. I currently plan to rework the php echo statements to use php fragments.
